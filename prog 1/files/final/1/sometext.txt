The United States Constitution is the supreme law of the United States. It was originally composed of seven articles, delineating the national frame of government. The first three articles establish the three branches of government: the legislative branch (Congress), the executive branch (headed by the President), and the judicial branch (headed by the Supreme Court). Articles Four through Seven describe the rights and responsibilities of the states, the process for ratification, and the amendment process.

The Constitution was signed on September 17, 1787, by delegates to the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It replaced the Articles of Confederation and has been amended 27 times since its ratification in 1788. The first ten amendments, known as the Bill of Rights, were added in 1791 to guarantee essential freedoms and rights.

The Constitution is a living document, meaning it can be interpreted and amended as society evolves. Some of the key principles enshrined in the Constitution include the separation of powers, checks and balances, federalism, and the protection of individual rights.
